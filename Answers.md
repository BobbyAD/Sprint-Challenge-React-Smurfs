1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    With client-side routing, page changes are handled by the user's browser, with data being passed with AJAX requests and JSON. Server-side routing involves the user requesting new HTML pages and being supplied with those. Client-side routing has the advantage of not having to refresh the page, but you have to download all the HTML right at the start. Server-side routing only supplies you with what you need, but you have to refresh when you want to change what the page is displaying.

2.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

    Create maps to POST, Read maps to GET, Update maps to PUT, Delete maps to DELETE.

3.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests

    You can make AJAX requests with Axios, Fetch, jQuery, or a number of other libraries.
